#  running the PixelFree backend. Copy it to `.env` and
#  replace placeholder values as needed.

#  IMPORTANT:
#   - Values marked "public" can be safely shared in code.
#   - Values marked "private" must NOT be committed to Git
#     or shared publicly. Keep them secret!
#   - The `.env` file itself should be excluded from version
#     control (see `.gitignore`).
#
#  Format:
#   - Lines starting with '#' are comments
#   - Key/value pairs are in the form: NAME=value
#   - No quotes needed unless the value contains spaces
